# Internet Access World Map


## 
The project is a simple map in plotly running in streamlit showing the internet access around the world for different years.
The final map can be accessed at https://apptestapp-arakcheevinetmap.streamlit.app/ (note: the app can go to "sleep" after a period of inactivity and the website will take some time to reload in that case).
